	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>Hi, my name is Noble Koshy and I am a recent graduate from the University of Minnesota. I graduated with a bachelors in Electrical Engineering and a minor in Business. I have always been interested in technology and how it is transforming our world. I remember growing up with just a simple desktop computer in my home (a HP Pavilion running Windows ME to be precise). Now I see my home filled with smartphones, laptops, tablets, and other smart devices. My educational background has given me a solid background in how such devices and other technologies work both on a hardware and software level. I am now seeking new career opportunities to expand and grow my knowledge. </p>
